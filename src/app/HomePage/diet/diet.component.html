            <p>Why is proper nutrition important in sport? Isn't it enough just to exercise regularly? The answer is “no”. During physical activity, available nutrients from the body's reserves are used, including minerals, proteins and vitamins. These essential nutrients are not sufficiently present in all foods, but they are necessary for a more successful sports experience. </p>
            <p>The general goal should therefore be to eat a wholesome and varied diet. This is particularly important with regular exercise, as the body needs these valuable nutrients. With proper nutrition, you can achieve multiple goals at the same time. On the one hand, it ensures increased performance, general well-being and, on the other hand, helps you specifically to build muscle or lose weight.</p>

        <h1>Balanced nutrition for athletes</h1>
        <p style="text-align: center;">In the following section, you will learn which nutrients are essential to live healthy and help you to achieve the optimal performance.</p>
        <div class="col mt-4">
           <h3>Complex carbs</h3>
           <p>Hobby athletes are recommended to attach particular importance to “good” carbohydrates in their diet. This supply of nutrients should be obtained from fruits and vegetables, for example. When you think of carbohydrates, you might think of pasta or bread. Although these can provide valuable nutrients, they are not all of the same value.</p>
           <p>There is a big difference between<strong> good and bad carbohydrates</strong>. The difference is that while the bad carbohydrates provide the body with energy, they also cause blood sugar levels to rise sharply, which is very unhealthy. Therefore, try to avoid sugar and products made from white flour and turn to<strong> whole grain </strong>bread instead. A supply of the last-mentioned products,<strong> fruits, vegetables and legumes </strong>will provide your body with valuable and healthy energy.</p>
           <p>In addition, you should also pay attention to the<strong> time of consumption </strong>of these carbohydrates. About two hours before exercise, you should no longer eat large meals that are rich in carbohydrates in order for your body to not have to spend energy burning the food, but rather use it for growing your muscles. This not only ensures a more comfortable workout for you because you don't have a full stomach, but also increases performance.</p>

           <h3 class="h">Protein</h3>
           <p class="text">Another building block of the human body is protein. Since<strong> largely consist of protein</strong>, these are particularly helpful for strength training or muscle building. Together with healthy carbohydrates, these are particularly effective. However, you should not take in more than 15% of the energy gain per day.<strong> Poultry, fish, low-fat dairy products, and legumes</strong> are good sources of protein. It is best to combine animal and vegetable sources of protein. Again, caution is advised here, as excessive protein gain can damage the kidneys.</p>

        <div class="col mt-4">
           <h3 class="h">Healthy Fats</h3>
           <p class="text">Fat is another source of energy. However, there are big differences in what<strong> types of fat </strong>should be consumed and which will help the body to perform well in sports. A rule of thumb is to consume a total of around<strong> one gram of fat per kilogram of body weight per day</strong>. Unhealthy fat can be found in foods like chocolate or butter. Multiply saturated fatty acids, such as those found in<strong> fish</strong>, for example, are extremely healthy when used in appropriate quantities. These so-called omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids strengthen the heart and circulation.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="water mt-5">
    <h3>Water</h3>
    <p>Not only the food, but also the choice of drinks influences the success of training and your well-being.<strong> A healthy adult should drink around 1.5 to 2.5 liters of water per day</strong>. However, the sweat that is lost through exercise has to be compensated for as well. Sodium-rich mineral water or fruit juices mixed with water are particularly suitable for this. The drinks should not be too cold and only contain little sugar, so the ratio of fruit juices should be around 2/3 water and 1/3 juice. By the way: Fruit juices are a suitable substitute for so-called isotonic or sports drinks and can even help to provide the body with more electrolytes and sodium.</p>

    <div class="box1 mt-5">
        <h1>Here are two more nutrition tips</h1>
        <p class="mt-4">1.<strong> The greatest danger of consuming unhealthy foods comes from snacks</strong>. Since our “snacks” are often only small portions in between, we pay less attention to the ingredients. However, these are mostly calorie bombs and only provide our body with very few valuable minerals or nutrients.</p>
        <div class="row mt-5">
        <img class="col ms-4" src="../assets/Nutrition-Pyramid.jpg"/>
        <p class="col">2. If you find it difficult to keep track of the appropriate percentage of food intake,<strong> the food pyramid could help you!</strong> It clearly shows that (healthy) carbohydrates are the basis of the daily diet. On the second and therefore second most important level you see fruits and vegetables, which should make up another large part of your diet. Animal products, meat and proteins are important, but should only make up a subordinate percentage of your energy intake. Ultimately, there are sweets, unhealthy fats and carbohydrates, which offer your body only minimal added value and should therefore be reduced to a minimum.</p>

        <h1>I am currently eating very unhealthily. Are there any tips and tricks for making a permanent switch to a healthy diet?</h1>
        <p class="p mt-5">As often in life, however, the following applies: The dose makes the poison. <strong> While it is important to eat healthy and appreciate your body, you can of course indulge occasionally in something that will keep you motivated and happy</strong>. The purpose of this is to reward yourself so that it is easier to eat healthier. Another tip for switching to a healthy diet in the long term is not to make extreme changes. If you are currently eating a little unhealthy, you should slowly introduce yourself to a change in diet, both physically and mentally. This means that you do not need to immediately throw away all the sweets and only buy fruit and vegetables, but gradually minimize the consumption of unhealthy and harmful foods and drinks while increasing the intake of healthy foods. If you make a radical change in your diet, your body can fight it and you run the risk of falling into old patterns after a while out of habit or simply losing desire and motivation.</p>

    <div class="box row mt-5">
        <h1>Do I actually have to eat more when I exercise?</h1>
        <div class="col">    
            <p class="para">Yes, those who are physically active have an increased energy expenditure and should therefore consume more. Often, however, the increased energy consumption is overestimated, since various activities usually do not burn as many calories as assumed. It is therefore advisable to check beforehand how many calories a particular sport burns for the time performed and to adjust your nutrition plan accordingly. A recommendation, however, is not only to pay attention to the increase in food, but also to keep an eye on the fluid balance. For example, a man burns around 448 calories in an hour of jogging, but sweats 750ml to 1500ml. This shows that you should keep an eye on the fluid balance when you exercise. Minerals such as calcium, magnesium or iron are lost through sweat, which must be replenished with the help of mineral water or tap water with a high mineral content.

        <h1>Here you have a small overview that can make your training easier and improve your performance:</h1>
        <div class="row mt-5">
            <h3>Before the training</h3>
            <p>As a rule of thumb, the shorter the time left before training, the less you should eat. It is best to refrain from eating about two hours before exercising. If this is not possible, you should make sure to eat easily digestible and low-fat foods that provide you with carbohydrates and proteins. You could eat oven vegetables with a little quark or raw vegetables on the side. Greek yogurt with fruit is also a delicious alternative for pre- exercise. If you have about two hours until the next training session, you can have oatmeal or muesli with some curd cheese too. Do not drink too much water before exercising, as this can lead to stomach ache.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="row mt-4">
            <h3>Durring the training</h3>
            <p>During training you should, if at all possible, refrain from eating so that your energy is focused on losing weight and building muscle and does not have to deal with digestion. Regularly drink small amounts of water or fruit juice mixed with water to restore your electrolyte balance.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="row mt-4">
            <h3>After training</h3>
            <p>After exercising, you should consume protein and a small amount of carbohydrates. Eat, for example, lentils, low-fat quark / curd cheese or lean meat. This replenishes the emptied energy stores and helps you build muscle and lose weight.</p>
